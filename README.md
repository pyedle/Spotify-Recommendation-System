# Spotify-Recommendation-System
Analysis of Spotify data and generation of recommendations based on playlist features using cosine similarity.

The code reads Spotify data from a CSV file and performs preprocessing tasks such as scaling numerical features and one-hot encoding categorical features. 
It then prompts the user for Spotify credentials, retrieves the user's playlists, and generates a DataFrame for a specific playlist. 
The cover art images of the playlist tracks are visualized. 
The code also generates a weighted playlist feature vector and uses it to generate track recommendations based on cosine similarity. 
The recommended tracks are displayed using their cover art images.
